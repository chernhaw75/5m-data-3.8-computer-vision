## Lesson Objectives

At the end of the lesson, learners shall be able to:

* Explain the fundamentals of Computer Vision and apply **classical image processing techniques**, using Python libraries to analyze and enhance digital images.

* Construct and train **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification, utilizing essential architectural components and optimization strategies.

* Implement **Transfer Learning** strategies by adapting pre-trained models through feature extraction and fine-tuning to efficiently solve complex computer vision tasks.
